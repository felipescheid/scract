## Scract

Best name I could find for: React from Scratch in 2024. I remember when I started working with React in 2018, when class-based components where the norm and React was _just a library!_ that you could add to your existing project. Fast forward to 2024 and class-based components are all but extinct, and the official docs actually advise *against* using React as a standalone library. They recommend a production-ready framework like Next.js, which has its own fancy features like routing and server-side rendering. I can only feel sorry for newbie web devs these days: _ Okay, I learned HTML/CSS/JS now let's build a website. Wait, what is this virtual dom business? I guess I'll need to learn React. Oh, I'll need Next.js for this, but better ensure I use the App router instead of the page router. Now I have this project directory with a 300 MB `node_modules` folder inside it, but whatever. I can finally build a website! _ A few months later, React compiler comes out.

I'm doing this as an exercise to understand what it would be like to set up a project from scratch using React. With all these frameworks that keep popping up, I want to ensure that I still understand how to use React as _just a library!_.
