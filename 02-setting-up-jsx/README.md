## Setting up JSX

We just saw how annoying it is to render elements using `React.createElement`, so we now want to use JSX to write the code for our components and then call Babel to transpile that to Javascript. We will then import that script to our `index.html` file. We will use `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` to tranform the JSX into JS. We will also need to install `@babel/core` and `@babel/cli` to run a CLI command to trigger this process. Finally, we will create an npm script called `build-02` that will call the babel CLI command.

Normally, we would want to add the dist files to `.gitignore`, but I'm committing those so you can see the output generated by Babel. Awfully similar to the code we wrote manually in chapter 1, is it not?

### Usage

Add your JSX code to `src/index.jsx` and run `npm run build-02` from the parent directory. Then open `dist/index.html` in your browser.
